# HTML & CSS Exercises

These exercises were completed while following tutorials by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell).  
All code and practice work here were written by me while learning from his lessons.

The goal of this repository is to document my progress in strengthening my HTML and CSS fundamentals.
